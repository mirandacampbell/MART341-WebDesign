      <h2>First, Lets Gather Our Ingredients!</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Homemade pie crust</li>
          <li>One 15oz can pumpkin puree</li>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>1 and 1/4 cups packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon ground or freshly grated nutmeg</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
          <li>1/8 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
          <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
          <li>Egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon milk</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Now Lets Put it All Together!</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><b>For the Pumpkin Pie Filling:</b> Whisk the pumpkin, 3 eggs, and brown sugar together until combined. Add the cornstarch, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, pepper, cream, and milk. <i>Vigorously</i> whisk until everything is combined. Filling will be a little thick.</li></br>
          <li>Preheat oven to 375&#176;F</li></br>
          <li><b>Roll Out the Chilled Pie Crust:</b> Remove 1 disc of pie dough from the refrigerator. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough out into a 12-inch circle. Make sure to turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls. Carefully place the dough in to a 9-inch pie dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. With a small and sharp knife, trim the extra overhang of crust and discard. Crimp the edges with a fork or flute the edges with your fingers, if desired. Brush edges lightly with egg wash mixture. Line the pie crust with parchment paper. (<i>Crunch up the parchment paper first so that you can easily shape it into the crust.</i>) Fill with pie weights. Make sure the weights are evenly distributed around the pie dish. Pre-bake the crust for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the parchment paper and pie weights.</li></br>
          <li>Pour pumpkin pie filling into the warm pre-baked crust. Only fill the crust about 3/4 of the way up. Bake the pie until the center is almost set, about 55-60 minutes give or take. A small part of the center will be wobbly - that's okay. After 25 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown. Check for doneness at minute 50, and then 55, and then 60, etc.</li></br>
          <li>Once done, transfer the pie to a wire rack and allow to cool completely for at least 3 hours. Serve pie with whipped cream if desired. Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also use extra pie crust to make leaves to decorate your pie as well as adding sugared cranberries much like in the images below!</p>
