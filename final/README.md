1. Everything we learned in this course was completely new to me, I have never taken any other type of Web Design course which meant that this whole course was quite the learning experience.
2. My answer to this question is ultimately the same as my answer to the first question! I truly knew nothing about web design or development prior to this class! I did have a lot of fun learning about design and development though!
3. I would say that because everything was new to me I almost never got anything correct the first time, so I spent a lot of time undergoing a trial and error process to make my webpages display the way I had envisioned them in my head!
