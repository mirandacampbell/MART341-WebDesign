1. System fonts are essentially named for what they are, fonts that certain systems have. They are the fonts that are already installed on your local device and available to you, but probably not available to the web. Web fonts are the custom fonts that are provided on a specific server, these fonts are optimized for use on the web but they are not always going to work. Web-safe fonts are fonts that are reliably available by the system and include font families that windows and mac both should have.
2. Fallback fonts create a sort of safety net when it comes to fonts because if someone else's system does not have that font, or if for some other reason the primary font can't be used, it can fallback to the next font choice in the font family.
3. I think the biggest challenge that I had this week was trying to find a way to style the page using fonts. I think it's easier to make a page look fun and exciting when the primary focus is the color scheme, but trying to use the fonts in a way that is appealing to view was harder for me.
