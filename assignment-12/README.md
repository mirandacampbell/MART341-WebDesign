1. The border allows us to create a boundary around something in many different forms such as dotted, dashed, solid, double, and many many more. We can then add padding which allows us to add or remove space in between the inner content of the element and element itself. Finally we can then add a margin which accounts for the amount of space between the border/box element and other elements on the page.
2. I think the biggest challenge I had was feeling like I hadn't done enough. First I used my page from last week and added a font from the internet instead of just web-safe fonts. But then this weeks additions are such subtle changes in some ways that I felt like my page didn't actually change a whole lot, but I believe all the elements are there so I just have to trust the process.
