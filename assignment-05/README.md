1. I just visited the old University of Montana page and it was interesting to see how different it looked then versus now. I think we have a lot more options and resources available on the current University of Montana page. It is also much more modern looking, as far as it being more linear rather than having images/icons attached to all of the links. 
2. I thought I was starting to get the hang of things but this week's assignment did not go well. I can see that the uploaded assignment 5 does not look at all like it is supposed to. I was very unsuccessful with the Github Desktop. I then tried to use atom, and felt good about it until I submitted it. I haven't had problems like this is the past, so I very sorry for all of the errors. I also know that I shouldn't have waited until Monday to do the homework, but I usually don't have any issues and this was my first chance to really look at it seeing as I had a lot of change in my personal life the last few days. Again, sorry for the awful assignment. I am not sure what went wrong, and even though it won't be for points, I will try to fix the issues tomorrow. 
3. I don't even have a screenshot at the moment because everything was unsuccessful. Sorry.
