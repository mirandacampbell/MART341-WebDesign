1. The id attribute should be a unique identifier for that specific element, while a class attribute is also an identifier, it groups together similar types of elements. This means that class attributes can utilize the same name value. The div element creates a block-level element that allows you to group other elements together. Within the div element you can add a span element which can group together elements within the block-level element.
2. The advantage of Youtube and Vimeo is that the process is fairly quick and easy seeing as you click 'share' and then 'embed.' However a disadvantage is that embedding videos can potentially slow down your website.
3. I struggled with trying to make sure that I correctly added all of the attributes, but I tried to overcome this by rechecking my work with the class website and other online sources.
