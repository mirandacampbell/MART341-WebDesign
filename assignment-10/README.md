1.The universal selector is used to style EVERY element on a page while the class selector is used to group certain elements and style them the same, and then the ID selectors are used to style single elements. 
2. The three colors that I chose to use were light pink, teal, and black. I chose the light pink for the background and the teal for the heading because they matched the same aesthetic as the pictures of the diners that I chose which I thought made the page more aesthetically pleasing to look at overall. I chose to use black for the comments underneath the pictures because I wanted a color that was easy to see and read underneath the images, but not a bright color that detracts from the vibrancy of the images.
3. Overall I felt as though this weeks assignment was pretty straight forward and I actually enjoyed being able to use different color elements to create an aesthetically pleasing site.
